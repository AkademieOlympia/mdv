Model Driven Views Polyfill

MDV is a Javascript shim which partially implements a design for HTML that supports a sensible 
dynamic separation between page display and the data which drives it.

MDV aims to get HTML to provide the essential foundation underlying most templating libraries. 
Further, it aims to allow dynamic web applications to declare the relationship between their 
data and presentation: updates to application data are reflected in the presentation and user 
input is assigned to application data.
